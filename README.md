Heart Disease Prediction Using Deep Learning
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user-provided health data using a deep learning model built with Keras. The model was trained on the UCI Heart Disease dataset and saved as heart.h5. The prediction system runs in Google Colab and accepts key medical parameters such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, and more.

Users can interactively input their health details in the notebook. Once the model file is uploaded, it processes the inputs and outputs a simple diagnosis: either “Heart Disease” or “No Heart Disease.” The project is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates how machine learning can assist in early medical risk prediction.

The repository includes a Colab notebook (heart_predict.ipynb) and the trained model file (heart.h5). In future versions, the project may expand to include web deployment and real-time retraining capabilities.

Note: This is only for study experiments of machine learning and not for real life predictions
